<p>Thus, from the war of nature, from famine and death, the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving, namely, the production of the <del>higher animals</del> <span style="color:pink;"><strong><em>Clarkia</em> flower</strong></span>, directly follows. There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone circling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being evolved. <br> <br> <strong>— Charles Darwin, <em> <br>On the Origin of Species</em> (1859)</strong></p>

</div></div>
<article class="drop-cap">
Earth’s vast biological diversity has been (and is being) created by the gradual splitting of one species into two, a process repeated countless times throughout history. For this reason, evolutionary biologists are fascinated by speciation. A crucial moment in speciation occurs when two populations, once separated, come back into contact. In many cases, they can still produce hybrids—but these hybrids are often unfit in one way or another.
</article>
<p><br></p>
<p>Wouldn’t it be cool if, at this stage, the populations could evolve a mechanism to preferentially mate with their own kind? The adaptive evolution of avoiding mating with a closely related species—a process known as <strong>reinforcement</strong>—does just that. However, the evolution of reinforcement is complex and has only been conclusively documented in a handful of cases.</p>
<p>Dave Moeller and colleagues (including me) have been investigating one potential case of reinforcement. <em>Clarkia xantiana</em> subspecies <em>parviflora</em> (hereafter <em>parviflora</em>) is an annual flowering plant native to California. Unlike its outcrossing sister subspecies, <em>Clarkia xantiana</em> subspecies <em>xantiana</em> (hereafter <em>xantiana</em>), <em>parviflora</em> predominantly reproduces through self-pollination.</p>

</div></div></div>
<p>Not all populations of <em>parviflora</em> self-fertilize at the same frequency. Dave has observed that populations sympatric with (i.e., occurring in the same area as) <em>xantiana</em> appear more likely to self-fertilize than allopatric populations (<a href="#fig-reinf" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;<span>1</span></a>). Over the past few years, we have conducted numerous studies to evaluate the hypothesis that this increased rate of self-fertilization has evolved via reinforcement as a mechanism to avoid hybridizing with <em>xantiana</em>.</p>
<p>Throughout this book, I will use data related to the topic of divergence, speciation, and reinforcement between <em>Clarkia</em> subspecies as a path through biostatistics. I hope that this approach allows you to engage with the statistics while not having to keep pace with a bunch of different biological examples. Below, I introduce the major datasets that we will explore.</p>

As a result, each “line” becomes a mosaic of ancestry blocks inherited from either initial parent of the RIL.

<p>To investigate which traits, if any, help <em>parviflora</em> populations sympatric with <em>xantiana</em> avoid hybridization, Dave generated Recombinant Inbred Lines (RILs). To do so, he crossed a <em>parviflora</em> plant from “Sawmill Road”—a population sympatric with <em>xantiana</em>—with a <em>parviflora</em> plant from “Long Valley,” far from any <em>xantiana</em> populations. After this initial cross, lines were self-fertilized for eight generations. This process breaks up and shuffles genetic variation from the two parental populations while ensuring each line is genetically stable.</p>
<p>By setting these RILs out in the field and observing how many pollinators visited each line, we hope to identify which traits influence pollinator visitation and ultimately hybridization. Because <em>parviflora</em> plants often self-pollinate and because pollinators effectively transfer pollen from the plentiful <em>xantiana</em> plants to <em>parviflora</em>, we assume that greater pollinator visitation corresponds to higher hybrid seed set. However, we will test this assumption!!!</p>

<p>Below is the hybridization dataset. For each plant in the field we genotyped eight seeds at species-specific markers to identify if they were the product of hybridization with <em>xantiana</em>. The phenotypes belong to the genotype of the maternal plant (i.e.&nbsp;they are the same as those in the pollinator visitation data set). I include data at both the level of the seed and a summary at the level of the maternal plant.</p>
