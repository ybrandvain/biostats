Yet, we are all trying to make the most of life in this era. We want to teach, learn, and grow.\nMoreover, I believe this content is increasingly important – statistics is obsessed with the critical evaluation of claims in the face of data, and is therefore particularly useful in uncertain times. Given this focus, and given that you all have different energies, motivations and backgrounds, I am restructuring this course slightly from previous years. The biggest change is a continued de-emphasis on math and programming – that doesn’t mean I’m eliminating these features, but rather that I am streamlining the required math and programming to what I believe are the essentials. For those who want more mathematical and/or computational details (either because you want to push yourself or you need this to make sense of things), I am including a bunch of optional content and support. I am also wrestling with the impact of LLMs in our education (more below).",

    "text": "Course philosophy / goals\nMy motivating goal for this course is to empower you to produce, present, and critically evaluate statistical evidence — especially as applied to biological topics. You should know that statistical models are only models and that models are imperfect abstractions of reality. You should be able to think about how a biological question could be formulated as a statistical question, present graphs which show how data speak to this question, be aware of any shortcomings of that model, and how statistical analysis of a data set can be brought back into our biological discussion.\n\n“By the end of this course…\n\nStudents should be statistical thinkers. \nStudents will recognize that data are comprised of observations that partially reflect chance sampling, & that a major goal of statistics is to incorporate this idea of chance into our interpretation of observations. Thinking this way can be challenging because it is a fundamentally new way to think about the world. Once this is mastered, much of the material follows naturally. Until then, it’s more confusing.\n\n\n Students should think about probability quantitatively.\nThat chance influences observations is CRITICAL to statistics (see above). Quantitatively translating these probabilities into distributions and associated statistical tests allows for mastery of the topic.\n\n\n Students should recognize how bias can influence our results. \nNot only are results influenced by chance, but factors outside of our focus can also drive results. Identifying subtle biases and non-independence is key to conducting and interpreting statistics.\n\n\n Students should become familiar with standard statistical tools / approaches and when to use them. \nRecognize how bias can influence our results. What is the difference between Bayesian and frequentist thinking? How can data be visualized effectively? What is the difference between statistical and real-world significance? How do we responsibly present/ interpret statistical results? We will grapple with & answer these questions over the term.\n\n\n Students should have familiarity with foundational statistical values and concepts. \nStudents will gain an intuitive feel for the meaning of stats words like variance, standard error, p-value, t-statistic, and F-statistic, and will be able to read and interpret graphs, and how to translate linear models into sentences.\n\n\n Students should be able to conduct the entire process of data analysis in R. \nStudents will be able to utilize the statistical language, R, to summarize, analyze, and combine data to make appropriate visualizations and to conduct appropriate statistical tests.",

Most of my material originates here (although I occasionally do things a bit differently). Buy the latest edition.\nCalling Bullshit (Bergstrom & West, 2020): This book is not technical, but points to the big picture concerns of statisticians. It is very practical and well written. I will occasionally assign readings from this book, and/or point you to videos on their website. All readings will be made available for you, but you might want to buy a physical copy.\nFundamentals of Data Visualization (Wilke, 2019): This book is free online, and is very helpful for thinking about graphing data. In my view, graphing is among the most important skills in statistical reasoning, so I reference it regularly.\nR for Data Science (Grolemund & Wickham, 2018): This book is free online, and is very helpful for doing the sorts of things we do in R regularly.

At the same time, no one will hire you to ignore this technology. Success lies in learning how to critically evaluate and work with LLMs—to validate their output, improve your own understanding, and create high-quality results.

Choose wisely.\n\nLearning from AI and having it help you solve problems will allow you all to do better and learn more than people have been able to do previously. Using AI to avoid learning – e.g. having it write or code for you without you thinking/learning will always come back to bite you in the ass.\nWhile you are ultimately in charge of your learning, I will provide plenty of opportunities for in-class, computer-free efforts to show your mastery of the subject.

    "text": "RILs between sympatric and allopatric parviflora\nWouldn’t it be cool if, at this stage, the populations could evolve a mechanism to preferentially mate with their own kind? The adaptive evolution of avoiding mating with a closely related species—a process known as reinforcement—does just that. However, the evolution of reinforcement is complex and has only been conclusively documented in a handful of cases.\nDave Moeller and colleagues (including me) have been investigating one potential case of reinforcement. Clarkia xantiana subspecies parviflora (hereafter parviflora) is an annual flowering plant native to California. Unlike its outcrossing sister subspecies, Clarkia xantiana subspecies xantiana (hereafter xantiana), parviflora predominantly reproduces through self-pollination.\nNot all populations of parviflora self-fertilize at the same frequency. Dave has observed that populations sympatric with (i.e., occurring in the same area as) xantiana appear more likely to self-fertilize than allopatric populations (Figure 1). Over the past few years, we have conducted numerous studies to evaluate the hypothesis that this increased rate of self-fertilization has evolved via reinforcement as a mechanism to avoid hybridizing with xantiana.\nThroughout this book, I will use data related to the topic of divergence, speciation, and reinforcement between Clarkia subspecies as a path through biostatistics. I hope that this approach allows you to engage with the statistics while not having to keep pace with a bunch of different biological examples. Below, I introduce the major datasets that we will explore.\nFigure 2: Making a RIL population: A cross between individuals from two populations is followed by multiple generations of self-fertilization. As a result, each “line” becomes a mosaic of ancestry blocks inherited from either initial parent of the RIL. The figure above (from Behrouzi & Wit (2017)) illustrates this process, with the original parental chromosome segments depicted in green and red.\nTo investigate which traits, if any, help parviflora populations sympatric with xantiana avoid hybridization, Dave generated Recombinant Inbred Lines (RILs). To do so, he crossed a parviflora plant from “Sawmill Road”—a population sympatric with xantiana—with a parviflora plant from “Long Valley,” far from any xantiana populations. After this initial cross, lines were self-fertilized for eight generations. This process breaks up and shuffles genetic variation from the two parental populations while ensuring each line is genetically stable.\nBy setting these RILs out in the field and observing how many pollinators visited each line, we hope to identify which traits influence pollinator visitation and ultimately hybridization. Because parviflora plants often self-pollinate and because pollinators effectively transfer pollen from the plentiful xantiana plants to parviflora, we assume that greater pollinator visitation corresponds to higher hybrid seed set. However, we will test this assumption!!!",

Their research addresses fundamental questions in evolution, such as:\nTo answer these big and exciting questions, Dave and his collaborators must break them down into smaller, direct scientific studies that can be addressed through a combination of experiments and observations. To conduct such studies, we must map these complex ideas onto measurable variables.\nFor example, rather than directly comparing the flower images in Figure 1, we simplify these flowers into variables that summarize them. For instance, we could represent a flower using a set of variables such as flower color, petal length, the distance between stigma and style, etc.\nDave and his team have conducted numerous studies to tackle these big questions. In most cases, they examine how the value of a response variable — the outcome we aim to understand — changes with different values of one or more explanatory variables (also called predictor or independent variables), which are thought to influence or be associated with the biological process of interest.\nUnderstanding the distinction between explanatory and response variables is crucial for framing hypotheses, designing experiments, and interpreting statistical results. However, this distinction often depends on how the research question is framed and can even vary within a single study.

Because most parviflora plants are either pink or white, we treat color as a binary categorical variable. But, as shown above, color can be measured and analyzed quantiatively as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n# INSERT POLINATOR OBSERVATION VIDEO \n\nVariables come in different flavors, and knowing the flavor of a variable is key to choosing appropriate summary statistics, data visualizations, and statistical models. Our parviflora pollinator visitation example above included both major types of variables (Figure 1):\n\nNumeric variables are quantitative and have magnitude. For instance, we measured pollinator visits as the number of times a pollinator visited a flower during a [5-minute observation period], and petal length in centimeters.\n\nCategorical variables are qualitative. In our example, flower color and genotype were treated as categorical variables.\n\nLike much of stats – the line between these types of variables is blurry. For example, we often treat color as a category, but color can be measured quantitatively (Figure 2). So depending on our question we may want to treat color as either a numeric or categorical variable.\n\nNot All Numbers Are Numeric. For example, a gene ID may be represented as a number, but it is an arbitrary label rather than a measurement. Similarly, in our Clarkia studies, some sites were identified by numbers (e.g., Site 22 or Site 100). However, Site 22 is not “less than” Site 100 — these are categorical variables, despite being represented numerically.\n\nWithin these two categories are further sub-flavors which allow us to further refine our statistical approach:\n\nTypes of Numeric Variables\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Types of numeric variables.

(image link)\n\n\n\n\nNumeric variables can be categorized into two main types:\n\nDiscrete variables come in chunks. For instance, flowers receive zero, one, two, three, and so on, pollinators. Pollinators do not come in fractions, making this variable inherently discrete.\nContinuous variables can take any value within a range. Classic examples include height, weight, and temperature. In our example, petal length is a continuous variable because it can be measured to any level of precision within its range.\n\n\nSubtle Distinctions and Blurry Boundaries. The two cases above represent pretty clear distinctions between discrete and continuous variables, but sometimes such distinctions are more subtle.\nConsider the number of pollinators—these cannot be fractional, but the number of pollinators per minute can be fractional. There are other similarly blurry cases. For example, time to first flower is inherently continuous, but we often check on flowers only once per day, so it is measured as discrete. Similarly, in human studies, age is usually reported in whole months or years (discrete), rather than on the more continuous scale of fractional seconds. In such cases, the appropriate question is not “is my data discrete or continuous?” but rather “what process generated my data? and what statistical distribution do the data follow?\n\n\n\nCategorical variables\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Species is a categorical variable: The Clarkia specialist – Clarkia Evening Bee, (Hesperapis regularis) on a Clarkia flower. Shared by © Gene H under CC BY-NC 4.0 copyright on iNaturalist. In our Clarkia research, pollinator is usually nominal (that is which bee species), but is sometimes binary (Clarkia specialist, or non-specialist), and sometimes ordinal (e.g. frequent pollinator, rare pollinator, never pollinator).\n\n\n\n\nCategorical variables are qualitative, and include, nominal, binary, and ordinal variables.\n\nNominal variables cannot be ordered and have names – like sample ID, species, study site etc…\n\nBinary variables are a type of nominal variable with only two options (or for which we only consider two options. Alive/dead, pass/fail, on/off are classic binary variables). In our example of pollinator visitation in parviflora, we considered only two flower colors (pink/white) so flower color in this case is binary.\n\nOrdinal variables can be ordered, but do not correspond to a magnitude. For example, bronze, silver and gold medals in the Olympics are ranked from best to worst, but first is not some reliable distance away from second or third etc… In our pollinator example, we often may wish to distinguish between frequent pollinators (e.g. specialist bees, Figure 4), common but less frequent pollinators (e.g. non-specialist bees), and rare/incidental pollinators (e.g. flies).",

Variables can be categorized as numeric or categorical, and further subdivided into types like discrete, continuous, nominal, binary, or ordinal. These classifications influence how we summarize, visualize, analyze, and modelize our data.\n\n\nChatbot tutor\nPlease interact with this custom chatbot (link here) I have made to help you with this chapter. I suggest interacting with at least ten back-and-forths to ramp up and then stopping when you feel like you’ve got what you needed from it.\n\n\nPractice Questions\nTry the questions below! Likert scales look like this:- How do you feel about Clarkia? (1) Love it  (2) Like it  (3) Don’t care  (4) Do not like (5) Hate it\n\nQ1) In a species with pink or white flowers, flower color is a special kind of categorical variable known as a ___ variable NominalBinaryOrdinalBimodal\n\n\nClick here for explanation\n\nThis was a little tricky! The correct answer is Binary, because there are only two possible values. If you picked either “nominal” or “bimodal,” you’re pretty close and definitely thinking along the right path, but not quite there! So let’s walk through these “not quite right” answers:\n\nNominal: Petal color is nominal in the sense that “pink” isn’t greater or lesser than “white”—the categories have no natural order. But because there are only two options here, the more specific (and better) description is Binary.\nBimodal: A bimodal distribution refers to a numeric variable that has two distinct peaks or clusters. If we had measured flower color quantitatively—say, by recording percent reflectance at 550 nm—and the data clustered around two values (say, “mostly pink” vs. “mostly white”), then the distribution would be bimodal. (But even then, we’d probably simplify it to binary for analysis.)\n\nIf you answered “ordinal,” you should probably take another look at the chapter—ordinal variables have a meaningful order, like “small,” “medium,” and “large.”\n\n.\nQ2) Which of these variables is best described as continuous? Flower color (pink, white)Petal lengthNumber of flowers on a plant\nQ3) The number of offspring produced by a single animal in one breeding season is: BinaryContinuousDiscrete\nQ4) TRUE or FALSE: Populations of Clarkia that we named 100 and 22 are numeric TRUEFALSE.\nQ5) TRUE or FALSE: A variable on a “Likert scale” (see margin for details) is clearly numeric TRUEFALSE.\n\n\nClick here for explanation\n\nThe word “clearly” is the key clue here. A Likert scale (like rating agreement from “Strongly disagree” to “Strongly agree”) is based on numbers (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5), but those numbers represent ordered categories, not truly continuous or clearly numeric values.\nIn other words, while you can treat Likert scale data like numbers sometimes (e.g., calculating averages), the numbers themselves are standing in for categories with an order—not for measured quantities along a true number line. So while you might have seen Likert data analyzed using means, t-tests, or even regressions—treating them like numeric variables—this is a common (and sometimes reasonable) modeling shortcut. Conceptually, Likert data are still clearly ordinal: they are ordered categories, not continuous measurements.\nIf you missed this, don’t worry — Likert scales can be a little tricky because they look numeric. But always pay close attention to what the numbers mean. If they’re just labeling ordered choices (rather than measuring something truly continuous, like height or weight), the variable is ordinal categorical, not clearly numeric.\n\n.\nQ6) The variable, kingdom (corresponding to one of the six kingdoms of life), is a ___ variable NominalBinaryOrdinalDiscrete\nQ7) TRUE of FALSE: A continuous variable can never be modeled as discrete and vice versa TRUEFALSE\n\n\n\n\nGlossary of Terms\n\n\nVariable: A characteristic or attribute that can take on different values or categories in a dataset.\n\nExplanatory Variable: Also known as a predictor or independent variable, this is a variable that is thought to influence or explain the variation in another variable.\nResponse Variable: Also known as a dependent variable, this is the outcome or effect being studied, which changes in response to the explanatory variable.\n\n\n\n\nNumeric Variable: A variable that represents measurable quantities and has magnitude, either as counts (discrete) or as continuous values.\n\nDiscrete Variable: A numeric variable that represents distinct, separate values or counts (e.g., number of pollinators).\nContinuous Variable: A numeric variable that can take any value within a range and is measured with precision (e.g., petal length).\n\n\n\n\nCategorical Variable: A variable that represents categories or groups and is qualitative in nature.\n\nNominal Variable: A categorical variable without an inherent order (e.g., flower species or study site).\nBinary Variable: A nominal variable with only two possible categories (e.g., alive/dead, pink/white).\nOrdinal Variable: A categorical variable with a meaningful order, but without measurable distances between levels (e.g., gold, silver, bronze).",
