comment: Possible advanced generation hybrids between Clarkia xantiana ssp. xantiana and ssp. parviflora where their ranges overlap. The white color (from some parviflora) has introgressed into a ssp. xantiana background. #clarkia #clarkiaxantiana

Every spring we census germinants of Farewell-to-Spring at 20 sites across its geographic range (can you spot any before swiping left in the photo above??). We're in our 14th year of demography data collection with Clarkia xantiana ssp. xantiana, and it's looking like a bumper crop due to early, consistent rains. Blooms this year will be ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯. These long term, intensive datasets are essential to understand the population dynamics of species, though they are quite rare! #plants #science #ecology #evolution #fieldwork

Clarkia xantiana has two subspecies that differ in mating system. This one (ssp. parviflora) is predominantly selfing and can be pink or white (parviflora = small flower) whereas ssp. xantiana is bee pollinated and always pink. The two colour morphs of parviflora often coexist, as seen in the 2nd and 3rd pics.
