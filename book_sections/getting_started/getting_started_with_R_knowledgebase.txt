## OVERALL CHAPTER: Getting Started with R

### Chapter-Wide Learning Goals

By the end of this chapter, students should be able to:

1. Explain why we are using R and RStudio.
2. Use vectors, do math, ask logical questions, and assign variables in R.
3. Use R functions and understand what a function is.
4. Install R packages.
5. Load data into R, view it, and identify types of variables.
6. Navigate the RStudio interface.

## Background Context for Students

This may be students' **first day using R**. Some students may have prior experience, but all should be treated as beginners unless they indicate otherwise. Students have just completed a short chapter on **types of variables**, and may refer back to it.

### Key Concepts from the "Types of Variables" Chapter

* Variables can be **categorical** or **numeric**.
* **Numeric variables**:

  * *Discrete*: Countable units (e.g., number of pollinators)
  * *Continuous*: Measurable, within a range (e.g., petal length)
* **Categorical variables**:

  * *Nominal*: No natural order (e.g., species name)
  * *Binary*: Exactly two values (e.g., pink vs. white flowers)
  * *Ordinal*: Ordered but unevenly spaced (e.g., rare/common)
* Students have seen examples from *Clarkia xantiana* to contextualize variable types.
* Students understand the difference between **response** and **explanatory** variables.

Tutors should expect and respond to confusion about variable types, including edge cases (e.g., site number is categorical even though it looks numeric).

## SECTION: Functions and Vectors

### Learning Goals

1. Use R functions.

   * Understand that functions take arguments and return outputs.
2. Use the pipe operator `|>` to pass output from one function to the next.
3. Create and use vectors in R.

### Functions Introduced

* `|>`, `log()`, `round()`, `c()`, `mean()`
* Assigning vectors with `<-`

---

## SECTION: Load Packages and Data

### Learning Goals

1. Understand what an R package is.

   * Install a package with `install.packages()`.
   * Load a package with `library()`.
2. Use `read_csv()` from the `readr` package to load CSV data from the internet.

### Packages Introduced

* `readr`, `dplyr`, `conflicted`

### Functions Introduced

* `install.packages()`, `library()`
* `readr::read_csv()`
* Introduced the `package::function()` format as a helpful but optional convention

---

## SECTION: Data Types in R

### Learning Goals

1. List different types of data R can store in vectors:

   * Numeric: `<dbl>`, `<int>`
   * Character: `<chr>`
   * Logical: `<logi>`
   * Factors (mentioned but deferred)
2. Identify a variable's data type.
3. Use logical expressions to create logical vectors (e.g., `a == b`, `a > b`, etc.).

### Operators Introduced

* Logical comparison operators: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`

---

## SECTION: Orientation to RStudio

### Learning Goals

1. Identify the **source pane** and what to do there.
2. Identify the **terminal/console pane** and what to do there.
3. Identify the **environment/history pane**, its contents, and how to navigate its tabs.
4. Identify the **files/plots/help/viewer pane**, its contents, and how to navigate its tabs.

## Core Concepts to Reinforce

* R is a language for data analysis and reproducible science.
* RStudio is a helpful interface (IDE) for working with R.
* Variables are assigned with `<-` and can store vectors.
* Functions do things; they take arguments and return results.
* Use named arguments and `=` inside functions; use `<-` only for assignments.
* The pipe `|>` helps chain functions together.
* Vectors are the basic data unit in R.
* Always inspect your data types after loading data.

## Tidyverse Style and Conventions

This book uses a **Tidyverse-inspired approach** but introduces it gradually. Students are expected to:

* Use `readr::read_csv()` to load data and `dplyr` for basic wrangling. For now they are loading data from a weblink, so avoid issues of directory structure etc, unless they bring it up (but you can help them with that if you like). Avoid `read.csv()` unless they bring it up, and if they do say something like "that works fine but we're using `read_csv()` because..."
* Use `dplyr::select()`, `filter()`, `pull()`, and other tidyverse verbs with tibbles. Avoid using `$` or bracket indexing for now, unless inspecting objects informally. Do not bring up "matrices", "arrays", "lists", and "data frames", unless students ask about them and if so help them connect these ideas to tibbles.
* Use the **base R pipe operator** `|>`, not the magrittr `%>%` pipe.
* Avoid `attach()` or other non-explicit scoping methods.
* Understand data as rectangular and column-oriented (variables in columns, observations in rows).

This encourages readability, reproducibility, and clear syntax while retaining compatibility with both base and tidy approaches.

## Awareness of Embedded Quiz Items

This tutor should be aware of the following embedded `webr` quiz questions to avoid giving direct answers, especially if students are working on assignments with similar structures. Instead, guide students using hints, conceptual reminders, and scaffolding.

### Sample Embedded Questions:

1. **Q1** – Understanding non-numeric argument errors (e.g., `"p"^2`).
2. **Q2** – Floating-point precision (e.g., `(0.2 + 0.1) == 0.3`). \[r thinks this is false because of floating point issues]
3. **Q3** – Understanding data types in built-in datasets (e.g., `iris$Species` is a factor).
4. **Q4** – Identifying column data types in a provided dataset (e.g., `"ratio"` should be numeric).
5. **Q5** – Whether a `<dbl>` can be safely cast to `<int>`.
6. **Q6** – Identifying ordinal categorical variables.
7. **Q7** – Calculating mean area using a formula and vectorized arithmetic.

> Some questions are designed to *force use of R* even if the answer could be guessed conceptually (e.g., Q1, Q2). These may involve issues like overflow or underflow but are not learning goals.
