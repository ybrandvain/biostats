**Motivating Scenario:**

You've just completed a big analysis and created a clear, honest `ggplot` figure that perfectly shows your main result. Now you realize you have to give a talk, write a paper, and present a poster. You're thinking about just using the same plot for each case, but realize that, forexample, no one will be able to read your axes labels if you present your plots in a talk. So now you want to customize your plot for the medium of presentation.\

**Learning Goals: By the end of this subchapter, you should be able to:**

1.  **Adopt a strategic mindset** for data visualization by recognizing that the "best" plot depends on its context and tailoring your design to the specific demands of the medium (e.g., talk, poster, paper).

2.  **Prepare publication-quality figures for scientific papers** by:
    * Combining multiple plots into a single, cohesive multi-panel figure using `patchwork`.
    * Applying clean, professional themes like `theme_bw()` or `theme_classic()`.
    * Formatting labels with mathematical symbols or italics using `expression()` and/or `ggtext`.

3.  **Design effective plots for live presentations** like talks and posters by:
    * Dramatically increasing text size for readability from a distance using `theme()`.
    * Using attention-grabbing visuals (like icons or isotype plots) to stand out in a crowded poster hall.

4.  **Enhance plots for digital mediums** by:
    * Making plots interactive with packages like `plotly` and `highcharter`.
    * Designing clear, compelling infographic components that tell a single, powerful story.

5.  **Know when to be pragmatic** by deciding between a pure-R solution and using graphics software for final, one-off annotations and design touches.

### Tailoring Plots for Your Medium

There are many ways to tell a story. You could share it informally with a friend, write it in a book, produce it as a play, or perform it live on stage (like on [The Moth podcast](https://themoth.org/podcast)). Even if the core story is the same, you would tailor your approach for each medium.

The same is true when presenting data visually. We've already discussed that a good plot is designed for its specific audience and purpose. You might present your findings in a scientific talk, on a poster, in a manuscript for a peer-reviewed journal,  a digital document, or perhaps "clickbait" or an infographic for a broader audience. Each of these mediums has different demands.

Here, we'll go over how to customize your plots in R for a few of these common formats.

**Make your life easier by knowing when you can skip doing it in R.**

R is great because it is reproducible and dependable.  What's more,  once you can do something in R, it's pretty straightforward to apply that skill to a new dataset. This comes in handy  when you'll be doing the same task a bunch. But figuring out how to do a very specific, one-off tweak in R can be a huge time sink, and sometimes it makes more sense to make final touches in powerpoint, illustrator, or photoshop than to figure it our in R. Before you spend hours on a minor customization, ask yourself a few questions. Here is the guidance I use when making this decision:

* **Frequency:** Will I do this sort of thing more than a handful of times? If so, I try to figure it out in R. If it's a one-off task, I often don't.  
* **Time Investment:** How long will this take to figure out in R versus doing it "by hand" in e.g. PowerPoint? If a manual edit in  PowerPoint takes five minutes, that's often smarter than spending two hours wrestling with code for a minor annotation.
* **Motivation:** Why do I want to do this in R? Is it for convenience, utility, and/or growth, or am I motivated by pride? Don't do it for pride!
* **Medium of Presentation:** What is my final output? There is an expectation that figures for published papers are highly reproducible, so I use R exclusively for such figures. But for posters and talks, I am more likely to do a final touch-up "by hand."

### Plots for a scientific talk  

#### Unfolding the narrative 

**We previously saw that talks offer a great opportunity to walk your audience through a plot as you build it up one step at a time.** We also saw that as you do so you can provide the audience with plausible alternative outcomes and how we would interpret them biologically. You can achieve this by working through your ggplot code slowly (e.g. initially exclude `geom_point()` etc) and using [`annotate()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/annotate.html) or even Powerpoint to add alternative outcomes.

```


**Plots in scientific talks require large text!** We achieve this largely through the `theme()` function where we use `element_text()` to customize a specific feature of our plot. 


Below is an interactive R session to get you started on this!    

- First, run the code as is to see the `initial_plot` with its default text sizes.    

- Next, copy and paste the code from the margin on the right into the session to see how `theme()` can change the text size.     

- *Challenge:* You will notice the y-axis tick mark labels are still small. Add a line of code inside `theme()` to make the axis.text.y larger as well.      

- Finally, feel free to add any other elaborations / explorations.  



```{r}
#| eval: false
#| column: margin
initial_plot +
   theme_linedraw()+
  theme(axis.text.x =  element_text(size = 18), 
        axis.title.x = element_text(size = 25),
        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 25),
        strip.text = element_text(size = 25),
        legend.position = "none")
```





```{webr-r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

initial_plot 
```


:::aside
**Remember [ggthemeassist](https://github.com/calligross/ggthemeassist)** can really help with these tasks, and is a great way to learn!
:::

:::protip
`ggplot2` has several built-in themes (like `theme_linedraw()` I added above) built into `ggplot2`. Read more [here](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html). Additional packages like  [`ggthemes`](https://github.com/jrnold/ggthemes#) or  [`hrbrthemes`](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/hrbrthemes) have even more options. 

As we did above, we can customize these themes - but be sure to do this after running the theme. For example, the code below makes a large x-axis title with `theme_linedraw`.

```{r}
#| eval: false 
initial_plot + 
  theme_linedraw() +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_text(size = 25))
```



By contrast, this next bit of code  makes a standard x-axis title size with `theme_linedraw`.


```{r}
#| eval: false 
initial_plot +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_text(size = 25) ) + 
  theme_linedraw()
```

Revisit the code above to see this for yourself.

### Plots for a poster presentation


**Like a plot for a talk, a plot for a poster must be readable from a distance.** In fact, for a poster, this is even more critical.

<p style="font-size: 100px; font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Text should be huge</p>

**Unlike a talk, a scientific poster does not get you a "captive audience."** Most poster presentations take place in large, crowded halls. So, I recommend having something about your poster that makes passersby want to look more closely. To achieve this, I often tend to break some of the standard plotting rules. For example, some carefully chosen "distractions" or "chartjunk" can get you attention. If you can do this while keeping your plot honest and interpretable, you're in great shape. 

- Below I show how you can add images as data points with the [`ggimage`](https://github.com/GuangchuangYu/ggimage?tab=readme-ov-file) package.    

- In the previous edition of this book, I showed how you could make bargraphs with pictures (so called "[isotype plots](https://richardbrath.wordpress.com/2020/10/03/the-transformation-of-isotype/)") with the [ggtextures package](https://github.com/clauswilke/ggtextures). Read my previous text [here](https://bookdown.org/ybrandvain/Applied_Biostats_2024/11-impRoving_R_figuRes.html#posters).

### Digital documents

**For online documents**. Digital formats open up opportunities to engage readers with interactive graphs and animations, making data visualization more dynamic and accessible. Here are some powerful tools to consider:     

- The [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) package allows you to build interactive web applications that let users update graphs, tables, and other visual outputs in real-time, facilitating exploratory data analysis and the creation of interactive dashboards.     
   
- [gganimate](https://gganimate.com/index.html) enables the creation of animations, bringing your data to life and capturing your audience’s attention more effectively.  I used this package to make all of the gifs throughout this book.     
   
- Other packages, such as [`plotly`](https://plotly.com/ggplot2/getting-started/), [`ggiraph`](https://davidgohel.github.io/ggiraph/), [`rbokeh`](https://hafen.github.io/rbokeh/articles/rbokeh.html), and [`highcharter`](https://jkunst.com/highcharter/), offer additional capabilities for creating interactive and visually engaging graphs. These tools make it easy for users to explore your data in a more hands-on way. For example, Figure @fig-highcharter shows an interactive plot that focuses on a specific penguin species when you hover over its points.

For more information, check out the [*Interactive Graphs*](https://rkabacoff.github.io/datavis/Interactive.html) chapter in *Modern Data Visualization with R* [@kabacoff2024]. For deeper exploration, see the book [*Interactive Web-Based Data Visualization with R, plotly, and shiny*](https://plotly-r.com/) [@sievert2020].

```{r} 
#| label: fig-highcharter 
#| fig-cap: "Example interactive plot using [`highcharter`](https://jkunst.com/highcharter/)"
#| message: false
#| warning: false
library(highcharter)

hchart(penguins, "scatter", hcaes(x = flipper_length_mm, 
                                  y = bill_length_mm, 
                                  group = species, 
                                  color = species))
```



### For Scientific Papers: Polishing for Publication

Scientific papers have specific conventions, and your plots should meet them to look professional and be clearly understood. As discussed in the previous section (read the bit on Brown M&Ms) scientists often judge a paper based on features of figures. So be sure to invest time in cleaning up the theme, precisely formatting labels with italics or mathematical symbols, and combining several plots into a single, multi-panel figure. 


---

#### Combining Plots into a Multi-Panel Figure

Often, a single figure in a paper needs to tell a complex story by showing multiple views of the data. The [`patchwork`](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/) package is the best tool for this job. It lets you combine separate `ggplot` objects into a single, publication-ready figure with panel labels (A, B, C, etc.). 

In @fig-patchwork we create three different plots from our Clarkia hybrid zone data and then combine them into one figure. Doing so, I highlight some tricks of [`patchwork`](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/):   

- The + sign combines plots right to left (but sometimes you need to give it [further directions](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/reference/plot_layout.html?q=plot_layout#value)).   
- The / sign combines plots up and down (but sometimes you need to give it [further directions](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/reference/plot_layout.html?q=plot_layout#value)).  
- [`plot_layout(guides = "collect")`](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/reference/plot_layout.html?q=plot_layout#value) combines like legends to minimize redundancy and prevent wasted space.  
-  [`plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'A')`](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/reference/plot_annotation.html?q=plot_annotation#value) adds  letters to plots.  

Read the [documentation](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/articles/patchwork.html) for more information.

```{r}
#| fig-height: 6
#| fig-cap: "A multi-panel figure created with the patchwork package to provide a comprehensive view of two floral traits in Clarkia subspecies. (A) A density plot showing the distribution of Herkogamy, revealing that subspecies 'P' (red) has much lower values than 'X' (green). (B) A similar density plot for Protandry. (C) A scatter plot revealing the positive correlation between the two traits. This combined view effectively shows both the individual trait distributions and their relationship in a single figure."
#| fig-alt: "A figure with three panels labeled A, B, and C. Panels A and B are density plots, showing a tall, narrow red peak near zero and a lower, wider green distribution for Herkogamy and Protandry, respectively. Panel C is a scatter plot showing a large cluster of red points in the bottom-left corner (low values) and a dispersed cloud of green points at higher values. A legend indicates red is subspecies P and green is X."

```

#### Adding Mathematical and Styled Text

Scientific papers require precision in labels. This can mean adding mathematical symbols for units (like mm²) or using italics for species names, as is standard in biology. These goals can be reached in more than one way. Two standard approaches are: 

- Using the [`ggtext`](https://wilkelab.org/ggtext/) package which allows you to write in html.  OR     
- Using the [`expression()`]()  function, which is more "classic R" but a bit of a pain. 

:::aside
**html help** I don't know how to write greek letter or whatever in html. Luckily you can consult these resources (for html [math symbols](https://www.toptal.com/designers/htmlarrows/math/) and html for [Greek letters](https://www.htmlhelp.com/reference/html40/entities/symbols.html) ) or ask a chatbot to help!
:::

Unfold the code below to see the  [`ggtext`](https://wilkelab.org/ggtext/) approach I used to make @fig-ital. Note however, that you will likely run into code doing it a different way elsewhere.    




```{r}
#| fig-cap: "Faceted histograms comparing the distribution of petal area for two subspecies. This plot italicizes subspecies names and uses a super-script to show that a value is squared."
#| fig-alt: "A two-panel figure displaying two histograms side-by-side. The shared x-axis is 'Petal Area (in mm²)' and the y-axis is 'Frequency'. The left panel, for 'C. x. parviflora', shows a reddish-pink histogram strongly skewed toward zero. The right panel, for 'C. x. xantiana', shows a teal histogram with a roughly normal distribution centered around 1.5. A legend below confirms the color mapping. This plot italicizes subspecies names and uses a super-script to show that a value is squared."

    ssp == "P" ~ "*C. x. parviflora*", # Use Markdown for italics
    ssp == "X" ~ "*C. x. xantiana*",
    ssp == "X?" ~ "Uncertain")) |>
  filter(ssp_name != "Uncertain")

ggplot(hz_phenos_formatted, aes(x = area, fill = ssp_name)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 15, color = "white", alpha = 0.8) +
  facet_wrap(~ssp_name) +
  theme_linedraw() +
  labs(y = "Frequency",
       x = "Petal Area  (in mm<sup>2</sup>)",
       fill = "Subspecies") +
  theme(strip.text = element_markdown(size =18), # Use element_markdown() to render italics
        legend.text = element_markdown(),# Use element_markdown() to render italics
        axis.title = element_markdown(size = 15),
        legend.position = "bottom")  
```

#### Using Publication-Ready Themes

The default `ggplot2` theme with its grey background is great for data exploration, but it's not the standard for formal publications. Part of this goes back to the "brown M&M thing" - readers trust  authors who make conscious decisions rather than defaulting to pre-set options. So, a standard step in making "publication-ready" plot is to apply a cleaner, simpler theme. As shown in @fig-theme, functions like `theme_bw()`, `theme_classic()`, or `theme_minimal()` can help! (see above). 





```{r}
#| label: fig-theme
#| fig-cap: "A comparison of `ggplot2` themes for a scatter plot of *Clarkia* traits. **(Left)** The default `theme_grey()` has a grey background and grid lines, excellent for data exploration. **(Right)** Applying `theme_classic()` removes the background and grid, creating a cleaner look often preferred for scientific publications."
#| fig-alt: "A side-by-side comparison of two scatter plots displaying the same data with different themes. The left plot, titled 'Default ggplot2 Theme,' has a light grey background with a white grid. The right plot, 'theme_classic()', has a white background and no grid lines, only solid black axis lines. Both plots show 'herk' versus 'prot' with data points colored by the 'ssp' category."
#| code-fold: true
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| code-summary: "Using publication style themes"
library(ggplot2)
library(patchwork) 

# A basic plot with the default theme
p_default <- ggplot(hz_phenos, aes(x = prot, y = herk, color = ssp)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Default ggplot2 Theme")+
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")

# The same plot with theme_classic()
p_classic <- ggplot(hz_phenos, aes(x = prot, y = herk, color = ssp)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
  theme_classic() + # Apply the new theme
  labs(title = "theme_classic()")+
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")

# Display side-by-side for comparison
p_default + p_classic
```

### From Chart to Infographic: Telling a Visual Story

So far, we have focused on making excellent charts for scientific communication. But what if you need to explain your findings to the public, on a website, or in a report for a general audience? That's when you move from a chart to an infographic. 

While a scientific plot must show the full, transparent distribution of data, an infographic often simplifies the view to make a single message more powerful and clear.  An infographic is much like poster presentation but with fewer details -- it should grab attention and  make a clear point and assume the audience trusts us. This means shifting your priorities from showing comprehensive data to communicating one single, powerful message. While we don't lie with infographics, our goal is to make the point clear, and not worry as much about transparency. 

Let's take our Clarkia hybrid zone data and create one component for an infographic. Our story is simple: **one subspecies has a larger petal area than the other.** Notice how the code below differs from our previous plots. We summarize the data before plotting, remove all axes, and use a bold title to state the main finding directly.  @fig-infographic is designed to be a self-contained story.

#| fig-cap: "An example of an infographic component created from the *Clarkia* dataset. The plot uses horizontal bars and direct labels to clearly show that *xantiana* has a larger average petal area than *parviflora* at each of the four field sites. Including photographs of the flowers makes the comparison more tangible and engaging for a general audience."
#| fig-alt: "An infographic titled 'Clarkia xantiana Has Larger Petals.' The main chart is split into four horizontal panels, one for each site: S22, S6, SAW, and SM. Each panel contains two horizontal bars comparing 'parviflora' (gray) and 'xantiana' (blue). The blue 'xantiana' bar is consistently longer than the gray 'parviflora' bar in every panel. Each bar is directly labeled with its numerical value. Below the chart are two photographs: a pinkish flower labeled 'parviflora' and a lavender flower labeled 'xantiana'."
