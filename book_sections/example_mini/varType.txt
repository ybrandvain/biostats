Types of Variables Chapter
Learning Goals:

Differentiate between categorical and numeric variables.

Distinguish among types of categorical (nominal, binary, ordinal) and types of numeric (continuous, discrete) variables.

Understand why it is important for statisticians to consider variable types when building models.


Introduction: You are beginning this biostatistics course with a familiar topic: types of variables. We're using this chapter not only to review concepts you may have heard before but also to help you get used to how this book works.

Key Concepts:

Clarkia xantiana is used as a motivating biological example. Researchers studying it ask questions that require mapping complex ideas onto measurable variables.

Response Variables are outcomes we want to understand.

Explanatory Variables are factors we think influence the response.

Variables come in two major types:

Numeric Variables: Quantitative, have magnitude (e.g., petal length, number of pollinator visits).

Categorical Variables: Qualitative, groupings (e.g., flower color, site ID).

Numeric Variables can be:

Discrete: Separate, countable units (e.g., number of pollinators).

Continuous: Measurable, any value within a range (e.g., petal length).

Categorical Variables can be:

Nominal: Categories with no natural order (e.g., species name).

Binary: Exactly two categories (e.g., pink vs white flower).

Ordinal: Categories with an order but no consistent spacing (e.g., frequent vs rare pollinators).

Subtle cases: Some data might appear numeric but are actually categorical (e.g., site numbers). Some variables blur lines between discrete and continuous (e.g., age in years measured discretely, but conceptually continuous).
