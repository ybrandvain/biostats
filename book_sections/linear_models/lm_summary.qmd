## Chapter summary

Linear models provide a unified framework for estimating the expected value (i.e., the conditional mean) of a numeric response variable as a function of one or more explanatory variables. These models are additive: the expected value is found by summing components of the model — the intercept plus the effect of each variable multiplied by its value. The sum of squared differences between observed values and predicted values describes how closely the data match the model’s predictions. Linear models can be descriptive tools that capture the structure, variation, and relationships in a dataset. In later chapters, we will build on this foundation to evaluate models more critically — assessing how well they fit, how reliable their predictions are, and how to diagnose their limitations.

### Chatbot tutor  



Please interact with this custom chatbot ([**link here**](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-6832957bbc8c81919f589ce7f76f92a3-linear-models-tutor)) I have made to help you with this chapter. I suggest interacting with at least ten back-and-forths to ramp up  and then stopping when you feel like you got what you needed from it. 

## Practice Questions


Try these questions! By using the R environment you can work without leaving this "book". To help you jump right into thinking and analysis, I have loaded the ril data, cleaned it some, and have started some of the code!  





:::exercises

**Q1)** What is the key difference between a scientific and a statistical model?  `r longmcq(c("Statistical models make predictions, scientific models do not.", "Statistical models can be wrong, scientific models cannot.",    answer = "Statistical models describe patterns, scientific models are built on understanding processes.",   "Statistical models make assumptions, scientific models do not.",    "There are no differences between scientific and statistical models."))`

---

**Q2**  Consider the `R` code and output below. The `(Intercept)` describes: `r longmcq(c( answer = "The mean bill depth of penguins in this dataset.", "The mean bill depth of all penguins.", "The mean bill depth of penguins of the \"reference level\" species.", "The expected bill depth if all the predictors are set zero."))`

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
library(palmerpenguins)
lm(bill_depth_mm~1, penguins)
```



**Q3)** Without running this code, predict which sex will be the reference level in the model: *lm(bill_length_mm ~ sex, penguins)*?  `r mcq(c("male", answer = "female", "whichever has the smaller mean", "impossible to predict"))`

---  

:::

**Q4 - Q7) Linear models with categorical predictors.** The penguins data has data from three species of penguins -- Adelie, Chinstrap and Gentoo. **To answer the following questions, consider the R code and output below and no other information** (that is, do not load these data into R). 

```{r}
lm(bill_length_mm~species, penguins)
```




```{webr-r}
# Use this are for calculations
# This is about understanding concepts
# So do not run linear models here.


```

**Q8)** The correlation between these variables is `r fitb(0.2555858, tol =0.01)`.  

**Q9)** The slope in this model is `r fitb(0.0641019, tol =0.01)`.  


**Q10)** The intercept in this model is `r fitb(14.58863, tol =0.6)`.

**Q11)** According to the model, what is the predicted bill depth (in mm) for a penguin with a 50 mm long bill  `r fitb(17.80913, tol =0.35)`.

**Q12)** A penguin with a 20 mm deep and 50 mm long bill will have a residual of  `r fitb(2.19, tol =0.2)` mm.

**Q13)**  According to the model, what is the predicted bill depth for a penguin with a 500 mm long bill  `r fitb(-10000000000000)` mm deep bill.

`r hide("Haven't gotten it yet?")`

**Of course you haven't!!** The correct answer, of course, is that you cannot predict outside the range of our data. See @fig-trex!

`r unhide()`

## 📊 Glossary of Terms

:::glossary

#### 📚 **1. Concepts of Modeling**

- **Statistical Model**: A mathematical description of patterns in data, often used to summarize, predict, or test hypotheses.
- **Scientific Model**: A conceptual model based on biological understanding, explaining processes in the real world.

---


#### 🔀 **2. Different Predictor Types**

- **Categorical Predictor**: A variable with discrete groups. Modeled by differences in intercepts across groups.
- **Numeric Predictor**: A continuous variable. Modeled by slopes showing expected change in the response per unit change in the predictor.
- **Indicator Variable**: A numeric coding of a categorical variable (e.g., 0 for "pink," 1 for "white").

- **Reference Level**: The baseline category in a categorical predictor against which other groups are compared.


#### 3. **Components of a Linear Model**

- **Conditional Mean, $\hat{y}_i$**: The predicted value of a response variable for given explanatory variable values.  
   - **General linear model form**:  $\hat{Y}_i = f(\text{explanatory variables}_i)$. 
   - **Linear combination form**:  $\hat{Y}_i = b_0 + b_1 x_{1,i} + b_2 x_{2,i} + \dots + b_k x_{k,i}$.    
- **Intercept (`b₀`)**: The expected value of the response when all explanatory variables are zero (sometimes called $a$). 
- **Slope (`b₁`)**: The expected change   $\hat{y}_i$ with change in the predictor.     
   - *For numeric predictor:* The expected change in the response for a one-unit increase in a numeric explanatory variable. $b_1 = \text{cov}_{x,y}/\sigma^2_x$.   
   - *For binary predictor:* The difference in the meane of non-reference and reference level.  
- $x_{1,i}$ The value of explanatory variable, $1$, in individual $i$.    
   - *For numeric predictors:* The value of the explanatory variable.    
   - *For binary predictors:* The value of the indicator variable.   
       - $x_1$ equals 0 for the reference group.  
       - $x_1$ equals 1 for the non-reference group.       

#### 4. **Concepts for Linear Models**.    
- **Observed value (`yᵢ`)**: The actual value of the response variable: $y_i = \hat{y}_i +e_i$.     
- **Residual (`eᵢ`)**: The difference between an observed value and its model-predicted value, $e_i = y_i-\hat{y}_i$.  
- **Residual Sum of Squares**: $\sum e_i^2$
- **Residual Standard Deviation**: A measure of typical residual size — how far off predictions tend to be $\sum e_i^2/(n-1)$.


---

#### 🚫 **5. Model Limitations**

- **Extrapolation**: Making predictions outside the range of observed data — generally unsafe.
- **Multicollinearity**: When explanatory variables are highly correlated, making it hard to separate their individual effects.
