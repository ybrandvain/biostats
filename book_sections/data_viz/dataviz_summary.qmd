An effective visualization allows you to rapidly communicate your key findings to your audience. The best visualizations are honest, transparent, clear, and accessible. They highlight important patterns while minimizing confusion or distraction, and they are thoughtfully tailored to both the audience and the format. Great figures avoid misleading elements and use design choices (e.g. captions, color, and labels) to guide interpretation.

 

### Chatbot tutor  {#datviz_summary_chatbot_tutor}   



Please interact with this custom chatbot ([**link here**](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-684745db4bb88191ab4e5e2e98226ce2-data-viz-tutro)) I have made to help you with this chapter. I suggest interacting with at least ten back-and-forths to ramp up  and then stopping when you feel like you got what you needed from it.

The tallest bar corresponds to \"one father\" (~60 males), while the other two bars (\"one sneaker\" and \"multiple sneakers\") are much shorter (~18 males each).

**Q7)** What is the biggest problem with  @fig-sneak3?   `r mcq(c("It does not show all the data",  "It does not make patterns easy to see", answer = "It does not display patterns honestly", "It does not draw graphics clearly"))` 


`r hide("Explanation")`

The y-axis is labeled \"count,\" so unlike @fig-sneak1 and @fig-sneak2, this plot shows only the number of cannibalism cases‚Äînot the proportion. As a result, a reader might misinterpret @fig-sneak3 and incorrectly conclude that broods with only one father are the most susceptible to cannibalism.

## üìä Glossary of Terms   {#datviz_summary_glossary-of-terms}     
 

:::glossary

#### üè∑ **1. Ô∏è Figure Elements & Interpretation**

- **Legend:** A guide that explains the meaning of colors, symbols, or line types in a plot. Helpful when symbols are ambiguous, but often unnecessary when direct labeling is used.      

- **Caption:** Text beneath a figure that highlights the main point and guides the reader‚Äôs interpretation. A good caption doesn‚Äôt just restate what‚Äôs shown‚Äîit helps make sense of it.

- **Direct Labeling:** Placing labels directly on or near data elements (e.g., lines, points, bars), so viewers don‚Äôt have to cross-reference with a legend. Especially useful in talks and posters.    
  
- **Redundant Coding:** Encoding the same variable multiple ways (e.g., using both color and shape for species). Can increase accessibility but should be used carefully to avoid clutter.

#### ‚ôø **2. Accessibility & Universal Design**   

- **Alt Text:** A textual description of a figure, written for people who cannot see it. Good alt text conveys the message of the figure, not just its parts.    

- **Accessibility:** Designing figures so they can be understood by people with diverse abilities (e.g., colorblindness, low vision, screen reader users). Often overlaps with universal design.    

- **Colorblindness:**  A common visual condition that affects how people perceive color. Plots should use color palettes and redundancy (e.g., line types) to remain interpretable without relying on color alone.   

- **Universal Design:** The principle of creating products and experiences‚Äîlike data visualizations‚Äîthat work well for as many people as possible, regardless of ability.   

### üí• **3. Visual Clarity & Distraction**   

- **Overplotting:** When data points are so densely packed they obscure patterns or hide important features. Common with large datasets; solutions include transparency, jittering, or summarizing.   

- **Chartjunk:** Any visual element in a plot that doesn‚Äôt help convey the data‚Äîlike heavy gridlines, excessive shading, or unnecessary 3D effects. Coined by Edward Tufte.   

- **Data Viz "Duck":** A graphic with unnecessary visual decoration (named after a duck-shaped building in Long Island). A plot that prioritizes aesthetics or novelty over clarity.   

- **Cognitive Burden:** The mental effort required to interpret a figure. Good visualizations reduce cognitive burden by being clear, consistent, and well-structured.
