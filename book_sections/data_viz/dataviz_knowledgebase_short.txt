## üéØ Chapter Learning Goals

Students should be able to:

* Match plots to audience and delivery context.
* Detect and revise misleading visual design.
* Improve clarity and interpretability through better labeling, ordering, and layout.
* Design accessible plots using universal design principles.
* Communicate with visual evidence via thoughtful captions, alt text, and inline writing.
* Distinguish effective from ineffective figures using comparison and critique.

---

## üß± Assumed Background

Students have already:

* Interpreted basic plots (e.g., scatterplots, barplots).
* Explored associations and linear models.
* Summarized data using center and spread.

They have **not yet** learned statistical inference (e.g., p-values, confidence intervals). This chapter focuses on **communication, ethics, and perception** rather than formal testing.

## üß© Section Summaries

---

### 1. üß≠ Audience and Delivery

**Core Ideas:**

* Figures should be tailored to *who* will see them and *how*.
* Different goals, constraints, and affordances exist across:

  * üìò Papers: static, detailed
  * üé§ Talks: sequenced, paced
  * üñºÔ∏è Posters: visual and bold
  * üíª Digital: interactive, flexible

**Audience Archetypes:**

* ü´µ Self/team (exploration)
* üß† Experts (review)
* ü§∑ Curious novices (adjacent fields)
* üì£ Public (simplified, accessible)

**Key Figures:**

* `fig-slide` (flipbook): reveals a plot gradually for talks.
* `poster_image`: shows how to optimize for visual impact in posters.
* `fig-highcharter`: shows interactive digital communication.

---

### 2. üîç Honest Plots

**Core Ideas:**

* A plot can be *technically correct* yet *visually misleading*.
* Students must recognize and correct:

  * Truncated or broken axes
  * Poor bin choices in histograms
  * Log scale confusion
  * Category misordering
  * False comparisons (e.g., due to differing group sizes)

**Key Figures:**

* `fig-truncY`, `fig-goodY`: demonstrate misleading vs. honest barplots.
* `fig-logscale`: shows importance of log tick annotations.
* `fig-date1/2`: warns about hidden seasonal context.
* `fig-map`: color scale mismatch.

**Tutor Notes:**

* Emphasize *visual integrity* over graphical polish.
* Connect to real-world consequences of misleading plots.

---

### 3. ü™û Transparent Plots

**Core Ideas:**

* ‚ÄúShow your work‚Äù via data transparency.
* Summaries can obscure structure, outliers, or weird patterns.
* Raw data > means alone ‚Äî but with care to avoid overplotting.

**Solutions:**

* Jittering
* Alpha blending
* Sina/violin/ECDF plots

**Key Figures:**

* `fig-datasaurus`: same stats, very different shapes.
* `fig-overplotting`: 9 panels show strategies for overlapping data.
* `fig-drake`: barplot vs. raw + summary reaction meme.

**Tutor Tips:**

* Clarify that raw ‚â† better *always* ‚Äî encourage thoughtful tradeoffs.
* Remind students that summary and transparency can coexist.

---

### 4. ‚ú® Clear Plots

**Core Ideas:**

* Make the message obvious.
* Design to reduce *cognitive burden*.
* Key tactics:

  * Direct labeling
  * Category ordering
  * Consistent color usage
  * Readable axes and layout

**Key Figures:**

* `fig-broman`: which plot best compares X and Y?
* `fig-xlab`: rotated vs. flipped labels.
* `fig-consistent`: color/label order consistency.
* `fig-direct`: inline labeling for clarity.
* `fig-order`: reorder factor levels for clearer comparisons.

**Tutor Emphasis:**

* Distinguish unclear from dishonest.
* Push students to ask: *What should the viewer take away?*

---

### 5. üö´ Avoid Distractions

**Core Ideas:**

* Avoid chartjunk and unnecessary effects (3D, animation).
* Aesthetics must serve meaning, not obscure it.

**Key Concepts:**

* *Chartjunk* (Tufte): unnecessary decoration.
* *Duck*: visual form overwhelms content.
* *Glass Slipper*: inappropriate visual metaphors (e.g., periodic table for IT tools).

**Key Figures:**

* `fig-bananas`: banana-shaped Venn diagram.
* `fig-3d`: rotating pie chart (style over clarity).
* `fig-slipper`: misused periodic table layout.
* `fig-goldbloom`: meme on poor design restraint.

**Tutor Notes:**

* Allow students to explore *why* some flashiness might still work (e.g., posters, memory cues).
* Challenge students to critically assess form vs. function.

---

### 6. ‚ôø Accessible Plots

**Core Ideas:**

* Design for *all viewers*, not just the average.
* Good accessibility = good science communication.

**Strategies:**

* Redundant encoding (e.g., shape + color)
* Direct labeling
* Accessible color palettes (`viridis`, `colorspace`)
* Font sizing for readability
* Alt text for screen readers

**Key Figures:**

* `fig-ishihara`: colorblindness test plate.
* `fig-biggertext`: small vs. large text comparison.
* `fig-accessibility`: ‚ÄúAccessibility is the law‚Äù graphic.

**Tutor Checklist:**

* Encourage grayscale tests and CVD emulators.
* Ask students to articulate plot takeaways in *non-visual* terms.

---

### 7. ‚úèÔ∏è Writing About Figures

**Core Ideas:**

* A plot needs clear *context*, *interpretation*, and *accessibility*.
* Avoid writing just what the plot *is* ‚Äî say what it *means*.

**Best Practices:**

* Captions should enhance, not repeat the figure.
* Alt text must summarize the *message*, not just the form.
* In-text discussion should link visual patterns to claims.

**Key Figure:**

* `fig-legend`: two versions of a vaccine plot.

  * Panel A: hard to decode.
  * Panel B: clear labels, strong caption.

**Tutor Guidance:**

* Help students compare vague vs. strong captions.
* Guide students to root their interpretation in *visual evidence*.

---

### 8. üìã Summary and Practice Questions

**Purpose:** Assess synthesis of concepts across sections.

**Figures Used:**

* `fig-hemo`: color vs. label vs. facet comparisons for hemoglobin.
* `fig-sneak1/2/3`: cannibalism plots with ordering, counts, and proportions.
* `fig-test`: marketing chart with multiple deceptive features.

**Key Practice Question Themes:**

* Redundancy and accessibility (`fig-hemo`)
* Axis ordering and interpretability (`fig-sneak1`)
* Raw vs. proportional data display (`fig-sneak2/3`)
* Honest pattern display (`fig-sneak3`)
* Misleading elements (`fig-test`)

**Open-ended Prompts:**

* Ask students to justify which plot they prefer and why.
* Prompt critique of visual deception or cognitive burden.
