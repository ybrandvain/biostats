## üß≠ Section-by-Section Tutor Guide

### Section 1: Audience and Delivery

**Core Message**: Effective plots are audience- and format-specific

#### Key Tutor Strategies:
- **When students ask "Is this plot good?"** ‚Üí Redirect: "Good for whom? In what context?"
- **Use the 4 Audience Archetypes** as framework:
  - ü´µ You & Team (exploratory, rough)
  - üß† Expert Critical Reader (detailed, technical)
  - ü§∑ Curious Novice (clear, guided)
  - üì£ Public/Non-Expert (engaging, simplified)

#### Common Student Misconceptions to Address:
- "One plot fits all audiences" ‚Üí Show how talk slides differ from paper figures
- "More detail = better" ‚Üí Discuss cognitive overload and poster sessions

#### Figure Teaching Points:
- **fig-audience**: Use to humanize the concept - these are real people with real needs
- **fig-slide (flipbook)**: Demonstrate pacing and sequential revelation
- **poster_image.png**: Contrast crowded environment with clear, bold design
- **fig-highcharter**: Show how interactivity serves digital audiences

### Section 2: Honest Plots

**Core Message**: Visual choices can mislead even with accurate data

#### Key Tutor Strategies:
- **Never immediately point to the problem** ‚Üí Ask "What impression does this give you?"
- **Use comparison approach**: Show misleading version first, then ask how to fix it
- **Emphasize unintentional bias**: Good intentions don't prevent misleading plots

#### Critical Teaching Moments:

**Truncated Y-Axes (fig-noY, fig-truncY, fig-regY)**:
- Ask: "What story does this tell about the differences?"
- Guide to: "How would starting at zero change your impression?"
- Connect to: "When might proportional representation matter most?"

**Unfair Comparisons (Monthly births)**:
- **Don't reveal it's about days/month** ‚Üí Let students discover
- Ask: "What's unusual about February in this pattern?"
- Guide discovery: "What makes months different besides weather?"
- Follow up: "How could we make this comparison fair?"

**Misleading X-Axes**:
- **fig-allmonths**: "Does this seasonal pattern make sense?"
- **fig-date1 vs fig-date2**: "What context might be missing here?"

#### Student Support Strategies:
- If stuck on bin size exercise ‚Üí "Try extremes first - what's too few? Too many?"
- If struggling with color maps ‚Üí "Does the visual order match the logical order?"

### Section 3: Transparent Plots

**Core Message**: Show the data unless you have good reason not to

#### Key Tutor Strategies:
- **Start with datasauRus**: "How can these be the same statistically but look different?"
- **Balance transparency vs. readability**: "When does showing all data help vs. hurt?"

#### Teaching Sequence:
1. **Establish value of raw data** (fig-datasaurus, fig-drake)
2. **Acknowledge overplotting problem** (fig-overplotting)
3. **Explore solutions** (jitter, sina, alpha, violin)

#### Common Student Questions:
- "Do I always show all data?" ‚Üí "What would be hidden by just showing means?"
- "Which technique is best?" ‚Üí Guide through fig-overplotting comparison
- "Isn't this just more work?" ‚Üí Connect to building trust and credibility

---

### Section 4: Clear Plots

**Core Message**: Guide attention to what matters most

#### Key Tutor Strategies:
- **Cognitive load framework**: "How many mental steps to understand this?"
- **Comparison focus**: "What comparison is most important here?"
- **Consistency emphasis**: "How does inconsistency hurt interpretation?"

#### Figure-Specific Guidance:

**fig-broman series**: Present as puzzle - "Which makes it easiest to compare X and Y?"
- Don't give answer ‚Üí Guide systematic evaluation
- Ask: "Where do your eyes go first?"

**fig-xlab**: "Which approach makes categories easiest to read?"
- Connect to: "When would you choose each approach?"

**fig-consistent**: "What happens when colors mean different things across plots?"

**fig-order**: "How does ordering affect the story this plot tells?"

#### Student Support:
- If overwhelmed by choices ‚Üí "Start with your main message. What do you want viewers to notice first?"
- If focused on aesthetics ‚Üí "Pretty is nice, but does it help understanding?"

### Section 5: Avoid Distractions

**Core Message**: Don't let style overshadow substance

#### Key Tutor Strategies:
- **Use Goldblum principle**: "Just because you can, should you?"
- **Function over form**: "What job does this visual element do?"
- **Acknowledge appeal**: "Yes, it looks cool. But does it help interpretation?"

#### Teaching with Figures:
- **fig-duck**: "When does a plot become more about its looks than its data?"
- **fig-bananas**: "What makes this harder to interpret than a standard Venn diagram?"
- **fig-3d**: "How does 3D affect your ability to compare values?"
- **fig-slipper**: "When does forcing data into a familiar format backfire?"

#### Nuanced Teaching:
- **Not absolute rules**: "Sometimes engagement matters more than optimal clarity"
- **Context dependent**: "A poster might justify more visual interest than a paper"
- **Audience awareness**: "Who are you trying to reach and why?"

---

### Section 6: Accessible Plots

**Core Message**: Universal design benefits everyone

#### Key Tutor Strategies:
- **Universal benefit framing**: "This isn't just for people with disabilities"
- **Practical testing**: "Try viewing this in grayscale. What happens?"
- **Redundancy principle**: "Never rely on color alone"

#### Teaching Progression:
1. **Establish importance** (fig-accessibility, fig-ishihara)
2. **Identify barriers** (small text, color-only encoding)
3. **Apply solutions** (direct labeling, accessible palettes, redundant encoding)
4. **Practice evaluation** (accessibility checklist)

#### Student Engagement:
- **fig-ishihara test**: "Can everyone see the number? What does this tell us?"
- **Grayscale challenge**: "Print this in black and white. What information is lost?"
- **Alt text practice**: "Describe this plot to someone who can't see it"

#### Common Resistance:
- "It looks boring now" ‚Üí "How might clear communication be more important than visual excitement?"
- "Too much work" ‚Üí "Which audiences matter most to your research?"

---

### Section 7: Writing About Figures

**Core Message**: Good writing supports good visuals

#### Key Tutor Strategies:
- **Caption vs. alt text distinction**: Different purposes, different audiences
- **Evidence-based description**: "Point to specific visual features as support"
- **Interpretation over description**: "What should readers learn, not just see?"

#### Teaching with fig-legend:
- Compare bad vs. good examples
- Ask: "What work does the reader have to do in each version?"
- Guide to: "How does clear labeling reduce cognitive burden?"

#### Writing Practice Framework:
1. **Identify the message**: What's the key takeaway?
2. **Point to evidence**: Which visual features support this?
3. **Connect to meaning**: Why does this pattern matter?

#### Student Support:
- If writing is too descriptive ‚Üí "Pretend you're making an argument. What's your evidence?"
- If alt text is too brief ‚Üí "How would you explain this to a friend over the phone?"

## üõ†Ô∏è Interactive Tutor Tools and Techniques

### Questioning Strategies:

#### Discovery Questions:
- "What patterns do you notice?"
- "What impression does this give you?"
- "Who might interpret this differently?"

#### Comparison Questions:
- "How do these two approaches differ?"
- "Which makes the comparison easier?"
- "What information is gained or lost?"

#### Application Questions:
- "How would you fix this?"
- "What would happen if we changed [specific element]?"
- "How does this connect to [earlier principle]?"

### Common Student Struggles and Responses:

**"I don't know what's wrong with this plot"**:
‚Üí "Let's walk through our principles. Is it honest? Clear? Accessible?"

**"This looks fine to me"**:
‚Üí "Try imagining different audiences. How might a [specific audience] interpret this?"

**"There are too many rules to remember"**:
‚Üí "Let's focus on the big picture: Does this help readers understand your data?"

**"My plot is boring now"**:
‚Üí "What's more important: looking exciting or communicating clearly? When might each matter more?"
